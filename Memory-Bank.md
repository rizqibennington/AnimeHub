7. **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile devices

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React Native (chosen for portfolio appeal and JavaScript ecosystem)
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **State Management**: React Context API / Redux Toolkit
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **UI Components**: React Native Elements or NativeBase

## API Selected
**Jikan API v4** (MyAnimeList unofficial API)
- Free and open source
- No API key or authentication required
- Comprehensive anime data from MyAnimeList.net
- Base URL: https://api.jikan.moe/v4/
- Key endpoints:
  - `/anime` - Search anime
  - `/top/anime` - Top anime rankings
  - `/seasons/{year}/{season}` - Seasonal anime
  - `/anime/{id}` - Anime details
  - `/genres/anime` - Anime genres

## Architecture Decisions
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with services, components, and screens
- **Component-based**: Reusable UI components for maintainability
- **API Layer**: Centralized Jikan API handling with error management and caching
- **State Management**: Context API for simple state, Redux for complex state if needed
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing for better development experience and error prevention

## Development Environment
- **OS**: Windows (Laragon environment)
- **Node.js**: Latest LTS version
- **React Native CLI**: For development and building
- **Android Studio**: For Android development and emulation
- **Xcode**: For iOS development (if available)
